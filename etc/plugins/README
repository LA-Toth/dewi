This directory contains the configuration files of installed plugins.
The configuration files are the plugin.yml files, symlinked to one of
the two subdirectories of the current directory.

* available: this may be empty, not used by DWA, it's just for the easier
  usage. This can contain the non-activated plugins

* activated: this directory contains the active plugins which are used
  by DWA.

  The symlink's name must be the same as the name specified within
  the corresponding plugin.yml with the .yml suffix.

  The 'core' and 'base' names are reserved, these YaML files are not loaded,
  but there are empty regular files with that names, Both of them mean
  the core DWA, not a real plugin.
